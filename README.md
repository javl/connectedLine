This openFrameworks project is part of a series of small experiments I made trying to learn more about generative algorithms.
Most of these are based on textual descriptions by Anders Hoff ([@inconvergent](https://twitter.com/inconvergent)).
I encourage you to check out his texts on different aspects of generative algorithms. Links can be found at the bottom of [his website](http://inconvergent.net/).
